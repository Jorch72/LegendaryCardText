I copied this repo from this [wiki branch](https://github.com/michaeljb/legendary-complete-card-txt/tree/wiki).

It's also here:
[https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Legendary_Marvel_Complete_Card_Text](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Legendary_Marvel_Complete_Card_Text)

Since the repo is no longer maintained - https://boardgamegeek.com/article/32243629#32243629, and I love this game, I'm going to try to continue it.

 Will try to migrate to xml so that using xsl it can be used to get this same format, also with xml, it can be used in randomizers and games like [mine](https://github.com/Jorch72/MyLegendary).

Regards,
Jorge
