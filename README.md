I copied this from [wiki branch](https://github.com/michaeljb/legendary-complete-card-txt/tree/wiki) this repo.

It's also:
[https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Legendary_Marvel_Complete_Card_Text](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Legendary_Marvel_Complete_Card_Text)

Since the repo is no longer maintained - https://boardgamegeek.com/article/32243629#32243629, and I love this game, I'm going to try to continue it.

Regards,
Jorge
